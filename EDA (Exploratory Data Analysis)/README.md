Data science is having a huge impact on the medical field, specifically in the area of cancer studies. In this project I will work with breast cancer data. This project focuses on data analysis using a simple step-by-step explanation.

## Project Overview
### Project Summary from Kaggle:
Features are computed from a digitized image of a breast mass. The cell nuclei in the image have certain characteristics. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server:

## Attribute information:
- ID number
- Diagnosis (M = Malignant(Cancerous) or B = Benign(Not Cancerous))
## Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Each image was analyzed for 30 features. The mean, standard error, and largest value of these features were computed. For example, the field "Mean Radius" is in field 3, the field "Radius SE" is in field 13, and the field "Worst Radius" is in field 23.

- All feature values are recoded with four significant digits

- Missing attribute values: none

- Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
